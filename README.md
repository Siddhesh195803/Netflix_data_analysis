# Netflix_data_analysis
This project involves analyzing Netflix data, inspired by Ankit Bansal's YouTube video on the same topic. The primary goal is to clean the data, import it into SQL Server using PySpark, and perform key analyses to extract meaningful insights. 

# Project Overview
# Data Collection and Cleaning:

Data sourced from Kaggle.
Performed data cleansing to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data quality.

# Data Importation:

Utilized PySpark to read and preprocess the data.
Imported the cleaned data into SQL Server for further analysis.

# Data Analysis:

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and identify patterns.
Implemented SQL queries to perform key analyses, such as genre distribution, trend analysis, and user behavior insights.
Technologies Used
Python: For data cleansing and initial processing using PySpark.
PySpark: For efficient data handling and preprocessing.
SQL Server: For storing and querying the data.
Jupyter Notebook: To document and showcase the analysis process.
